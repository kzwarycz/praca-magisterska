This repository contains scripts and components for my Master's thesis.

The goal of this experiment is to compare the performance, resource usage and developer experience when developing web applications using low-level programming language like Rust and high-level programming language like JavaScript.

The experiment uses the following technologies:

1. Low-level stack

- Rust
- [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
- [Yew](https://yew.rs/)

2. High-level stack

- Javascript
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

3. High-level lean stack

- Javascript
- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
